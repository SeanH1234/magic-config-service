### magic-config-service
This project contains the source code used to create a deployable war for use in a java container (Apache Tomcat/Jetty etc) that manages a set of properties that can be accessed remotely via REST over HTTP. The basic implementation of a property repository utilizes a lightweight datastore. This keeps the footprint small and extremely portable.
